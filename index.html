        <h2>  About me...</h2>
        <p>
          I am an IT enthusiast living in Brno.
          I'm mainly interested in front-end, but I have been programming in C the longest time.
          I am currently learning Three.js... I am fascinated by the 3D webdesign.
          I'm looking for a job in IT because I want to improve and learn new skills.
          So far, I have a non-systematic approach... so I've learned a lot of technologies and programming 
          languages... but I don't master any "flawlessly".

        <p>
          My hobbies... 

          I spend my free time by reading books, exercising on workout playground or at the events with my friends.
